# 🤖 AI Newsletter - Automated News Curation System

**A full-stack AI-powered newsletter application built for spring internship application showcasea at Cloudflare**

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is an intelligent newsletter system that automatically fetches news from multiple sources, uses AI to generate concise summaries, and delivers personalized newsletters via email. The entire system runs serverlessly on Cloudflare's edge computing platform, demonstrating modern cloud architecture and AI integration skills.

### What This Project Does

1. **� News Aggregation**: Automatically fetches latest news articles from NewsAPI across multiple categories (Technology, Business, Science, Health, Sports, Entertainment, General)

2. **🤖 AI Summarization**: Uses Cloudflare Workers AI (Llama 2) to generate intelligent, concise summaries of each article, making them easier to digest

3. **📧 Personalized Delivery**: Sends beautifully formatted, personalized newsletters to subscribers based on their selected interests via email

4. **⏰ Automated Scheduling**: Runs completely autonomously with daily cron jobs - no manual intervention required

5. **📱 User Management**: Provides a clean, responsive web interface for users to subscribe and manage their newsletter preferences

This project is a fully-automated newsletter service that fetches news based on user preferences, uses an LLM to rephrase it in simple terms, and emails the daily briefing to subscribed users.

## Overview

The application consists of two main parts:
1.  A public-facing configuration page where users can subscribe with their email and select news categories of interest.
2.  A scheduled daily task that fetches the latest articles for the selected categories, uses AI to create simple summaries, and emails the personalized briefings to each subscriber.

## Tech Stack & Features

- **LLM:** Uses the Llama 3 model via **Cloudflare Workers AI** to rephrase and summarize news articles.
- **Workflow / Coordination:** A **Cloudflare Worker** handles user subscriptions and is triggered by a **Cron Trigger** to execute the daily newsletter generation and sending process.
- **User Input:** A static HTML page allows users to subscribe and configure their preferences.
- **Memory / State:** User subscriptions and preferences are stored in a **Cloudflare D1** database.

## Setup & Configuration

You will need an API key from a news provider like NewsAPI.

### Secrets

Securely store your NewsAPI key so the Worker can access it. In your terminal, run:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key from NewsAPI
npx wrangler secret put NEWS_API_KEY
```

## Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd cf_ai_newsletter
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the local development server:**
    This command starts a local server that simulates the Cloudflare environment, including access to a local version of the D1 database.
    ```bash
    npx wrangler dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
